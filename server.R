      <p>A <a href = 'https://www.gov.scot/groups/population-task-force/'>Population Taskforce</a> 
      and Population Programme were established in June 2019 by the Scottish Government to consider 
      Scotland’s future population challenges.</p>
      
      <p>The <a href = 'https://nationalperformance.gov.scot/'>National Performance Framework</a> 
      (NPF) includes an indicator on Scotland’s population under the National Outcome “we are open, 
      connected and make a positive contribution internationally”. This dashboard includes the NPF 
      indicator as well as a number of other indicators to monitor progress and understand the 
      challenges facing the population programme. These are structured around population structure 
      and distribution, priority areas agreed by the Population Taskforce.</p>
      
      <p>As agreed by the Population Taskforce, the Scottish Government’s aim is to make communities 
      across Scotland attractive places to live, work, bring up families and to move to; so that 
      Scotland’s population profile improves sustainable and inclusive economic growth and wellbeing.</p>
